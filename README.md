# Everything Sovol SV06

A repository containing specifications of the Sovol SV06 3D printer parts, as well as links to aftermarket replacement parts.

Besides many hours, I have spent roughly ~~CAD$80~~ CAD$85 on unusable parts in order to find aftermarket replacements for the SV06. If you found this work useful, please consider buying me a [<img src="./misc/logo_white_stroke.png" height="20" alt='Ko-fi'/>](https://ko-fi.com/bassamanator).

You can also contribute by making a [pull-request](https://github.com/bassamanator/everything-sovol-sv06/pulls), creating an [issue](https://github.com/bassamanator/everything-sovol-sv06/issues), or starting a [discussion](https://github.com/bassamanator/everything-sovol-sv06/discussions).

## To do:

- [ ] Add stepper motor information.
- [x] Add Z coupler specs.
- [x] Add heatblock specs.
- [ ] Verify heatblock specs.
- [x] Add heatbreak specs.
- [ ] Add heater cartridge specs; no aftermarket source to be found.
- [ ] Add thermistor specs and aftermarket [source](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmxAvaV).
- [X] Add PSU related information.

## Stay Up-to-Date

This repository is a work in progress. Watch for updates:

| Label | Connection | PCB Connection | Other Connection | Other info |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| P3 | Coldend fan | JST 1.25mm 2-Pin |  |  |
| P2 | Extruder motor | JST 1.25mm 4-Pin | JST PH 2.0 6-Pin (*needs confirmation*) | Cable length 12cm |
| P4 | Heater cartridge | JST PH 2.0 2-Pin |  |  |
| P8 | Thermistor | JST 1.25mm 2-Pin |  |  |
| P6 | Probe  | JST 1.25mm 5-Pin |  |  |
| P5 | Part cooling fan | JST 1.25mm 2-Pin |  |  |
| P7 | Filament sensor | JST 1.25mm 3-Pin |  |  |

### Filament Sensor

I tested two random filament runout sensors that I had on hand. Both work just fine. It seems to me that any sensor with `VCC`, `Ground`, and `Signal` pins should work.

In order to get the filament sensor working, just make sure that the `VCC`, `Ground`, and `Signal` line up with the pins on the hotend PCB, port `P7`.

In order to 'mount' the sensor while it's not in use, simply glue a small magnet onto the sensor. You can then stick the sensor onto the extruder motor. You might also want to tether the sensor to the extruder cable with a piece of string.

Klipper filament configuration section:
```
[filament_switch_sensor filament_sensor]
switch_pin: !PA4 # "Pulled-high"
pause_on_runout: True
insert_gcode:
    M117 Insert Detected
runout_gcode:
    M117 Runout Detected
```

The complete Klipper code to make this work is part of my [OSS Klipper Configuration](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware).

#### Aftermarket Options

These can be found for very cheap (roughly $1.5) on Aliexpress and quite a bit more on  Amazon (though still very afforable). [This](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDLpdBX) is the one I bought. Here's another seemingly [viable option](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDPNmDX).

##### How To Cable

You need to make your own cable. I recommend getting these [JST 1.25 cables](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDORZ0D), and this [XH2.54 kit](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlejPpj). You will also need a crimping tool such as the [Engineer PA-09](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B002AVVO7K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
### Heatblock

#### Aftermarket Options

I purchased and tested [this heatbreak](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmzWJNb). It works as well as the stock piece.

*The part sold in the link could change, so make sure it has the following specs*:
